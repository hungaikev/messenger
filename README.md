## Messenger Service


### Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/hungaikev/messenger.git
    cd messenger


### Build the code 
You need to download and install sbt for this application to run. ( Might take a while if you have slow internet)
If this is your first time running SBT, you will be downloading the internet.

    cd messenger
    sbt compile


### Run the Tests 

    cd messenger
    sbt test

### To generate the coverage reports run

    $ sbt coverageReport

### Running
Once you have sbt installed, the following at the command prompt will start up Play in development mode:

```
sbt run
```

Play will start up on the HTTP port at http://localhost:9000/.   You don't need to reploy or reload anything -- changing any source code while the server is running will automatically recompile and hot-reload the application on the next HTTP request. 

### Usage

If you call the same URL from the command line, youâ€™ll see JSON. Using httpie, we can execute the command:

```
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/balance
```

To make a deposit execute the following command 

```
http -f POST http://localhost:9000/deposit/1000
```

Likewise, you can also make a withdrawal:

```
http -f POST http://localhost:9000/withdraw/200
```
